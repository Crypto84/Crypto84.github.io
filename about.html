          <p>Bart:
            Yo! Hey what's happening dude?
            I'm a guy with a rep for bein' rude
            Terrorizin' people wherever I go
            It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow
            Fixin' test scores to get the best scores
            Droppin' banana peels all over the floor
            I'm the kid that made delinquency an art
            Last name, Simpson; first name, Bart
            I'm here today to introduce the next phase
            The next step in the big Bart craze
            I got a dance, real easy to do
            I learned it with no rhythm and so can you!
            So move your body, if you got the notion
            Front to back in a rock-like motion
            Now that you got it, if you think you can
            Do it to the music, that's the Bartman
            
            Back-up Singers:
            Everybody if you can, do the Bartman!
            Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man!
            Move your butt to the side, yes you can, can!
            Everybody in the house, do the Bartman
            (x2)
            
            Bart:
            It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks
            I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep
            Homer was yellin', mom was, too
            Because I put mothballs in the beef stew
            Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom
            Sittin' by myself, confined to my room
            When all else fails, nothin' else left to do
            I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove!

            Back-up Singers:
            Move your body, if you got the notion
            Front to back in a rock-like motion
            Move your hips from side to side now
            Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now
            If you've got the groove, you gotta use it
            Rock rhythm in time with the music
            You just might start a chain reaction...
            
            Bart: If you can do the Bart, you're bad like Michael Jackson
            
            Back-up Singers:
            Everybody if you can, do the Bartman!
            Shake you body, turn it out..If you can, man!
            Move your butt to the side as you can, can!
            Everybody in the house do the Bartman...Do the Bartman!
            
            Bart:
            Do the Bartman!
            Everybody back and forth, from side to side
            Back-up Singers: Do the Bartman!
            
            Bart: Do the Bartman!
            Now here's a dance beat that you can't deny!
            Homer: Turn it down! Will you stop that infernal racket?
            Back-up Singers: Do the Bartman!
            
            Bart:
            Oh my ears! Lisa! Put that saxophone away!
            You can't touch this!
            I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. You can't prove anything
            Now, I'm in the house feelin' good to be home
            'Til Lisa starts blowin' her damn saxophone
            And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away
            But still I'm feelin' good, so that's okay
            I'm up in my room, just a-singin' a song
            Listenin' to the kicks while I'm kickin' along
            Yeah, Lisa likes jazz, she's her number one fan
            But I know I'm bad, cause I do the Bartman!
            
            Back-up Singers:
            Everybody, if you can do the Bartman!
            Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man!
            Move your butt to the side, as you can, can!
            Everybody in the house, do the Bartman! Do the Bartman!
            
            Bart:
            Do the Bartman!
            Everybody back and forth from side to side
            Back-up Singers: Do the Bartman!
            
            Bart: Do the Bartman!
            She can do it, he can do it, so can I!
            Back-up Singers:If you've got the groove, you gotta use it
            Rock rhythm in time with the music
            You just might start a chain reaction...
            
            Bart:
            I'm a Bartman
            
            Back-up Singers:
            Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman!
            Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man!
            Move your butt to the side, as you can, can!
            Everybody in the house do the Bartman!
            Move you body, if you got the notion
            Skake your body to the rock-like motion!
            Move your hips from side to side now
            Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now!
            If you've got your groove, you gotta use it!
            Rock rhythm in time with the music!
            
            Bart: Eat your heart out, Michael!
            Back-up Singers: You just might start a chain reaction...
            Bart: Oh wow, man</p>
